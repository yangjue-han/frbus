The November 2018 release of the FRB/US model package contains a new
version of the model, one that is significantly different than the
previous version.  Many of the modifications reduce the complexity and
scope of the model via the consolidation, aggregation or elimination
of various model variables and equations whose contribution to the
major properties and uses of FRB/US is relatively minor.

One of the major changes is the elimination of interest rates whose
values are expressed on a compounded annualized basis, that is,
interest rates who names end with an "E", such as RFFE.  As a result,
the key monetary policy instrument in FRB/US now is the conventional
measure of the federal funds rate, RFF.

model," FEDS Note, November 2018, by Jean-Phillipe Laforte, and (b) in
