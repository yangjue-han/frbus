' Program for simulation under VAR expectations that illustrates how
' to set the monetary policy options that impose the zero lower bound
' on the funds rate and delay the liftoff of the funds rate from the
' ZLB until either the unemployment rate falls below a threshold or
' inflation rises above a threshold.
'
' See FRB/US Simulation Basics document for general information about
' this program.

' Additional notes:

' 1. The scenario involves a set of negative aggregate demand 
' shocks and a positive risk premium shock that start in 2003q3,
' when the baseline (historical) funds rate is about one percent.
' The shocks are equal to the equation errors actually observed
' in the four quarters starting in 2008q4.

' 2. To impose the ZLB set %zb = "yes" (rather than "no")

' 3. To impose the policy liftfoff threshold conditions set both
' %zb = "yes" and %threshold = "yes".  For illustrative purposes
' and reflecting the baseline conditions in 2003 and the years
' that immediately follow, the inflation threshold is set to 3.0
' and the unemployment threshold is set to 7.0, subject to the
' the adjustments described next.

' 4. Because the threshold conditions only make sense once the ZLB is
' binding, unemployment is above its threshold level (lurtrsh),
' and inflation is below its threshold (pitrsh), which is not the
' case in the initial simulation quarters, the program turns on the
' threshold code (using dmptrsh) in the 5th simulation quarter,
' at which point these conditions hold. In addition, for the threshold 
' code to work properly, the endogenous switch variable dmptr must be 
' zero in the quarter prior to the quarter in which the threshold code is 
' turned on.  This is accomplished by setting the baseline data on dmptr 
' to zero and by setting the unemployment and inflation thresholds
' (lurtrsh, pitrsh) to values in the first four simulation quarters that
' would not flip the dmptr switch to one. 

' 4. Choose one of the five available policy rules by setting
' %policy to one of rffintay, rfftay, rfftlr, rffalt, or rffgen.

' 5. If neither the ZLB or thresholds are imposed, the monetary policy
' equations have baseline-tracking adds and the simulation is
' a standard deviations-from-baseline exercise. 

' 6. If either the ZLB or thresholds are imposed, the add factors on 
' monetary policy equations are set to zero after the tracking adds
' are computed so that the ZLB and threshold conditions are based on the
' actual simulated outcomes for the funds rate and inflation and unemployment,
' not their deviations from baseline.
